In this project I have explored models like:
1. Regression Models - Linear Regression
2. Classification Models - Logistic Regression
3. Advanced Modeling - Overfitting vs. Underfitting and Train-test split
4. Model Evaluation - Regression Metrics and Classification Metrics
5. Standardization
6. Decision Trees
7. Random Forests
8. Naive Bayes Classification
9. Cross-Validation
10. Model Optimization
11. Neural Networks
